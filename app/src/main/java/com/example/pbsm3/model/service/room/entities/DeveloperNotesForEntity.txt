1. According to stackoverflow, room only supports 5 data types which are TEXT, INTEGER, BLOB, REAL and UNDEFINED.
java data types of Boolean, Integer, Long will be all converted to INTEGER in SQL.
It is also safe to assume that data types beyond primitive such as BigDecimal won't be supported either.

2. The solution for the above issue is to have 2 classes, the usual class and the adapter/wrapper class.
The adapter/wrapper class converts the class into a Room-friendly format.
Refer to Category calss for example. 2 functions are included in the class file to convert between them.

3. I wrote this note so tha contributors can follow and keep the coding practice standardized.
